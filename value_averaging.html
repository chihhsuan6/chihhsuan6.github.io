                <div class="post_title">基金定期定額、定期定份、定期定值投資，別再傻傻分不清楚了！</div>
                基金作為職場新鮮人最常見的投資工具之一，大家普遍都有基金「定期定額投資」是平滑投資成本的觀念 (什麼，沒有嗎？那你還不趕快訂閱我...)，但所謂的定期定額的＂額＂到底是指固定的基金份數、投資價值、投入金額；又或是好吃的嘉義鹹水鵝呢？<br />
                <br />
                <br />
                好吃的鹹水鵝 (越寫越餓...)<br />
                定期定額、定期定份、定期定值投資的差別在哪？我們舉個例子<br />
                假設投資人看好＂小賈基金＂，決定分五次申購，用這三種方式投資分別會得到這些結果：<br />
                <br />
                <br />
                分五次投入，期間漲跌幅度都一樣，最後回到初始價5元，這樣怎麼投資難道也有差？<br />
                定期定額：指每月投資"固定的金額"<br />
                <br />
                每次投入金額為100元，期末購得份數共117.61份，獲利88.08元。<br />
                定期定份：指每月投資"固定的基金份數"<br />
                <br />
                每次固定購買20份，期末共購得100份，獲利持平。<br />
                定期定值：指每月讓基金成長"固定的價值"<br />
                <br />
                有些人可能看不太懂為何＂定期定值＂最後要賣出33.33份，我來說明一下：定期定值的目標是讓投資價值每次成長100元，在第四次購買結束時我們共有133.33份，在第五次購買時基金的淨值為5，所以這時我們的投資價值為<br />
                <br />
                133.33 x 5 =666.65 (元)<br />
                為了讓資產回到第五次的目標500元，我們要賣出部分基金：<br />
                666.65–500=166.65(元) 166.65/5=33.33(份)<br />
                這就是我們要賣出的部分：33.33份<br />
                最後，我們將三種投資方式做個整理，定期定額、定期定份、定期定值的優缺點逐漸母湯...不是啦，是逐漸浮現：<br />
                <br />
                <br />
                定期定額、定期定份、定期定值優缺點大比拚<br />
                定期定額一段話總結：<br />
                優點：壓縮買進成本<br />
                缺點：標的持續成長而沒有調整定投金額，將會導致購得份額越來越少<br />
                定期定額在長期牛市時，會導致購得的份數越來越少，所以需要定期調整。<br />
                <br />
                定期定份一段話總結<br />
                特點：在長期上升的市場中持續投入，長期下跌的市場減少投入<br />
                定期定值一段話總結<br />
                優點：三者中最高的報酬率、最低的平均購入成本<br />
                缺點：投入的總投資金額卻變少，導致總獲利可能輸給其他定投方式<br />
                從上表可以發現，定期定值能帶來最低的買進成本，其投報率高過了定期定份與定期定額，但是，他也有個問題，就是"總投資金額"最低，長久下來，他的投資總值和獲利金額也會變的最低。<br />
                <br />
                為什麼呢？因為我們限制了每期投資價值的增長，如果超過我們就會賣掉，如果基金持續上漲，我們因為賣掉了份額，就無法享受到後面的利潤。<br />
                <br />
                最後，來做個總結吧！ 下面我已2010–2018投資美股ETF為例，就能看出定期定值的缺點<br />
                <br />
                <br />
                定期定值的強項在於壓低購買成本，但長期下來也造成購買份數過少，總獲利輸給其他兩種定投方法。<br />
                在長期牛市時，投資人需要注意定期調整"每期投資價值"的增長，才不會造成投資報酬率漂亮，但投資總金額卻很少，進而在獲利上輸給其他兩種定投方式的窘境。<br />
                <br />
                另外，在長期熊市時，他會使投資人每期投入的資金越來越多，這種投資方式也需要良好的投資心態。<br />
                <br />
                對於大多數的懶人投資者來說，最好的投資方式是定期定額(其次定期定份)，因為他不需要特別堅強的投資心態，也不需要承擔市場下跌時加碼投入的心理壓力，也相對能花比較少的時間追蹤投資標的的狀況，唯一需要注意的，就是要定期調整投入金額，符合自己的實際狀況！<br />

                Value averaging is one of many investing techniques, up there with dollar-cost averaging and buying on the dip. Plenty of people love it, but it’s not without its haters. Below, I’ll explain exactly what it is, how it works, and why it might (or might not) work for you.<br /><br />                Related Article -  Maybe You Shouldn't Maximize Your 401(k) Match<br />
                What Is Value Averaging?<br />
                Value averaging is an investment strategy very similar to dollar-cost averaging, but more complicated. While dollar-cost averaging invests the same amount every period, value averaging changes how much you invest, based on past performance. Because of this, value averaging investors need to put a bit more thought into each investment.<br /><br />
                Despite being more complicated than dollar-cost averaging, it’s still pretty simple. Instead of defining how much you’ll invest each period, you define how much your investment balance must grow each period.<br /><br />
                Suppose you start investing and want your investment balance to grow by $1000 every month. You would start by investing $1000 on the first day of the first month. Then, you wait until the first of the second month to see what the balance is. This new balance will tell you how much you need to contribute.<br /><br />
                For example, suppose your balance is $1050 at the beginning of month two. In this case, you would need to invest only $950 to maintain your $1000/month growth goal. But, what if your balance is $950 at the beginning of month two? Then, you would need to invest $1050 to maintain your $1000/month growth goal.<br /><br />
                Adjusting these periodic investment amounts allows you stay on something called your value path. The value path describes how much should be in your investment balance during each time period. By increasing investments when markets under-perform and decreasing investments when market over-perform, you stay on your value path.<br /><br />

                Why Is a Value Path Important?<br />
                Fans of value averaging say your value path helps keep you on track to meet your goals. More importantly, your value path helps you invest more when the markets lose value and less when they gain value. This limits buying too many high-priced stocks, and promotes buying stocks at a discount.<br /><br />
                For my spreadsheet-savvy readers, you can calculate and plot your value path with the equation shown below.<br /><br />
                V=Ct(1+R)^{t}<br /><br />
                In this equation, V is the value path, C is the periodic contribution, t is the time period, and R is the investment’s average rate of return in that period.<br /><br />
                This equation makes a few assumptions. First, it assumes your desired contribution stays the same every period. With inflation, this will probably not be true over the long run. As inflation lowers the value of your contribution, you’ll want to increase your contribution to even it out.<br /><br />
                Second, this equation assumes the average rate of return stays the same every period. While the average annualized return on the stock market is around 10%, this changes a lot year after year. Average returns during the 1990s were very different from the average returns during the 1970s. The smaller the period you choose, the more you’ll need to stay on top of this average rate.<br /><br />
                You can also rearrange this equation to help plan for future goals. Suppose you know what you want your V to be in 10 years. You could solve this equation for C to help determine what your contribution needs to be to stay on this path. Likewise, you could do something similar for R.<br /><br />                Related Article -  Forget Net Worth. What's Your Wet Worth?<br />                What Are the Pros of Value Averaging?<br />
                Value averaging encourages you to invest more in the market during price declines and less when the price increases. This can help give a greater return on your invested money without more risk, but this is controversial (see below). Also, by investing whatever you need to stay on track, you help stay in control of your financial future.<br /><br />

                What Are the Cons of Value Averaging?<br />
                You might’ve noticed the Pros of Value Averaging section of this article was pretty short. Well, that’s because there are a lot of cons and criticism surrounding value averaging.<br /><br />
                To start, value averaging does a poor job of utilizing your investment money. By only contributing what you need to stay on track with your value path, you risk missing out. Suppose you have $2000 available to invest, but you only need $1000 to stay on track. The other $1000 just sits in a pool waiting to be used, not earning anything.<br /><br />
                Contrary to this problem, you risk running out of money during major economic downturns. Suppose the market prices just keep falling. You would need to start investing more and more money to maintain your value path. If the market falls enough, you might run out of money to contribute. With value averaging, you risk both investing too little or too much.<br /><br />
                Also, value averaging tends to show better rates of return on your money, but this is misleading. While it encourages you to invest more when the market falls, you still have money not doing anything, waiting to be invested. So, while the invested money might outperform dollar-cost averaging, it’s actually not doing better if you include the un-invested money.<br /><br />
                Therefore, while value averaging yields a higher return rate on your invested money, you don’t end up with more money.<br /><br />

                Alternatives to Value Averaging<br />
                The most popular alternative to value averaging is dollar-cost averaging. Dollar-cost averaging is just investing the same amount of money every period. Whether the stock price goes up or down doesn’t matter, just invest the same. Suppose you choose to invest $1000 every month. Just buy however many shares that $1000 will let you buy.<br /><br />                Dollar-cost averaging is beneficial because it helps average out the price that you pay for a stock. Dollar-cost averaging also takes out most of the work seen in value averaging. Instead of doing any math or sticking to a value path, just invest the same every period. This technique is easy, and it helps prevent you from running out of investment money if the market keeps dropping.<br /><br />
                The second alternative to value averaging is lump sum investing. Lump sum investing is basically investing everything at once, without spreading out the investment over time. This has the benefit of exposing your investment to the market longer than dollar-cost averaging or value averaging allows.<br /><br />
                The main downside to lump sum investing is investing everything right before the market falls. But, since nobody can really predict the market, this is a fool’s errand to guess. After all, the market is just as likely to rise after a lump sum investment. Most studies have shown lump sum investing performs better than dollar-cost averaging and value averaging over the long-term.<br /><br />                What do you think about value averaging?
